# Beginner steps to add, commit and push a project

1) Once you create a Java project in eclipse go to bash and change your directory to that project
2) Next initialize (git init)
3) (git add "file name) or (git add .) to add files
4) git commit -m " your message"
5) git remote add origin "repo link"
6) git push -u origin master

Once that is complete you can continuously add, commit and push your work to Git Hub!
